# SQLPythonDemo
Notebook and files from the SQL in Python Demo, 2022/11/15

The presentation notebook as filled in during the demo is `SQLPython.ipynb`. If you want to build your own copy of the database, instructions are in `CreatingSQLTable.ipynb`. You'll need to have a PostgreSQL server running to follow them exactly, or switch to sqlite.
